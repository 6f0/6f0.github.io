<h1>liberate.exe</h1>
<p>It's a simple little command line program to help wrangle large text files on a windows system.</p>
<p>This is especially true if you're running on a machine that doesn't get the latest updates for one reason or another.</p>
<p>The download is below, it's a work in progress so there's no installer or anything like that. Just unzip it and start using liberate.exe from the command line (cmd or powershell.</p>
<p>To get a feel for what it does run liberate.exe -h to see the help menu.</p>

<strong>Currently it supports these arguments</strong>
<pre>
	-n: set a specific line number to view.

    e.g.:

    	liberate.exe -n 10 <file>

    	-- this will display line 10 of the file.

	* or specify a range of lines.

    e.g.:
    	
    	liberate.exe -n 10,20 <file>

        -- this will display lines 10 through 20 of the file.

    -p: adds an extra 'newline' between lines.

    -tail: tails a file from the very end. This is a very rough 
           implementation, use at your own peril.
