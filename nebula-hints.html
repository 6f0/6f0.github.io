<p>I would assume that if you're already here looking for this you probably already know about <a href="https://exploit-exercises.com">exploit exercises</a>. But if not, go check out the site and specifically the <a href="https://exploit-exercises.com/nebula/">nebula exercise</a> that corresponds to this page.</p>

<h2>level00</h2>

<p>look at the setuid man page to learn more about it what it does.</p>

<p>Find out how to locate files/executables with a setuid bit</p>

<p>$ find / -perm /u=s -user flag00</p>

<p>work your magic...</p>

<h2>level01</h2>

<p>know about how linux finds executables and symbolic links</p>

<p>recognize that the program has a vulnerability in the way it envokes 
echo. use the knowledge from the first step to exploit this knowledge</p>


<h2>level02</h2>

<p>For this level we can see that the programmer is wise to us changing the 
bin directory but that they are still pulling in a username which we
control...</p>


<h2>level03</h2>

<p>As it says crontab runs every few minutes; from checking the script in 
flag03's home directory we can see what's happening just find a way to
exploit it</p>

<p>I choose to just create a simple shell script:</p>

<p>[redacted]</p>

<p>but I'm thinking another interesting thing would be to create a setuid
program and have the cron update everything so we having lasting permissions 
as flag03</p>

<h2>level04</h2>

<p>In this level again, a knowledge of symbolic links is key</p>

<h2>level05</h2>

<p>This level requires some knowledge of unix file permissions so you can snoop 
around for juicy looking files. Finally an understanding of how the SSH 
encryption and connection process works [1]</p>

</ol>

<h2>level06</h2>

<p>As said in the description a knowledge of how unix systems stored passwords;
once that part is figured out. John the ripper can help with the rest.</p>

<h2>level07</h2>

<p>To start cd to the flag07 directory and have a look at the files, from there 
it's possible to find enough information to get started. Now all that's 
left is to find a way to inject getflag.</p>

<strong>Bonus hint:</strong>

<p>Make sure to properly URL encode</p>

<h2>level08</h2>

<p>those pesky file permissions again, just poke around in flag08's home 
directory to see what juicy files we can get our eyes on. </p>

<strong>Bonus hint:</strong>

<p>WireShark Analyze &gt; follow &gt; tcp </p>

<h2>level09</h2>

<p>very interesting, after trying the usual exploits i stumbled across 
the possibility of doing something like this:</p>

<p>which works! However, after all that time I spent figuring that out 
it turns out 'flag09 -a' gives you the interactive command line as the
flag09 user! Trivial from there...so simple yet for me; so hard to find</p>

<h2>level10</h2>

<p>interesting, trying various things to solve this one and then...
in my home directory there's a file called x. I go ahead and take a look in
there and low and behold it seems to be a token. It worked to sign into 
flag10 but that's not how it was supposed to go...</p>

<p>I'll have to work on finding the real way of exploiting this one</p>


<h2>That's all</h2>

<p>That's as far as I had time to get so far. I hope that you found these hints helpful without spoiling the fun.</p>

<p>Anything else let me know in the comments below.</p>
